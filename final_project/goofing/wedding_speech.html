          Processional ends


Welcome!

Good afternoon and welcome everybody! Please be seated.

Before we get any further—yes, Stephen and Sara are getting married by one of the bingo guys. For those of you who I haven’t met, I’m Tif. A good friend of Sara and Stephen’s from San Francisco.

To start the ceremony, we ask you to take part in the warming of Stephen and Sara’s rings. We’ve got two ringbearers, Lisa and Candice, at the back there—they’ll begin passing the rings. As one comes to you, please hold it in your hands, take a moment to make a silent wish for the couple, and pass it onto the person next to you—and if you’re at the end of an aisle, please pass the ring to the person in front of you.

On behalf of Sara and Stephen, thank you for being here. Thank you to the families of the bride and groom, and thank each and every one of you for making the trip to be here today. We’re lucky to share this time and space with each other, and especially lucky to lead lives where love is not rare. I’m honored to be here with you all, marrying these two wonderful people. I will do my best to get through the ceremony without crying.

Stephen and Sara are two of my favorite people—even if knowing them makes me feel lazy sometimes—I’m sure some of you can empathize.

Sara is like a sister to me. We shared an apartment, first with our friend Gino, then with our friend Kate. We’ve hosted house parties together, gone on countless hikes, sauteed bushels of kale, and been there to share each other’s joys and talk through each other’s problems. She’s driven and compassionate, fiercely loyal and fun-loving. She’s a friend I trust completely and would definitely recommend managing any project. She’s the kind of person who enjoys surfing, skiing, and hiking all in one day for her birthday—which is crazy. She should maybe try out for American Ninja Warrior.




And what about Stephen?

For the record, I liked Stephen before he and Sara started dating. He’s the one person I’ve met who can keep up with Sara. And fortunately, he has as much patience as he does endurance. He’s thoughtful, adventurous, and genuinely cares about people and is interested in the things people care about. Being around Stephen, you can feel this bedrock of confidence and calm in everything he does—and he’s funny too.

In Sara’s words, Stephen is the kind of person who can make unloading a uHaul truck, packing up another apartment, unloading the truck again, all in the pouring rain, while hungover, somehow fun. And Sara, this is a man who drank Fernet with you, told you he likes it, and then months later opened up and admitted that he hates Fernet and did it only for you—the man endures.

And as great as they are individually, they’re even better as a couple.



Wedding Sermon - The Love Story


Their love story began like so many others in San Francisco—at a friend’s vegan Thanksgiving held in an industrial loft space while dating other people.

They casually talked about upcoming trips to Kenya and that was about it for a while.

Fast-forward to Halloween 2014, at Virgil’s Sea Room in Bernal Heights. Stephen as Pee-Wee Herman, Sara as Hilary Clinton—both looking good in suits. That’s the night this whole thing really started. Both of them remember time stopping, other people in this packed bar fading away, an unexpected hand hold on the walk back to the bar, and next thing you know Pee Wee and Hilary were smooching before their drinks arrived. Then came a 0.7 mile piggyback ride home (yes I google-mapped it)—which was a good early indication for Stephen about the kind of physical demands this relationship would put on him.

And so began a relationship that’s spanned two cities, a house, a dog, a dozen Subarus, and nearly four years. And look at them now. You’ve turned a Halloween hook-up into the love of a lifetime.

With that, I’ll turn it over to two people who’ve know Stephen and Sara their whole lives, Justin and Seth. Justin...

Exchange of Vows - Marriage Story

Thank you so much for your words, Justin and Seth.

Love is the promise of the brave. That’s a line from a band I love, TV on the Radio, and it’s true, loving someone is one of the bravest things you can do. It takes guts to make yourself vulnerable. It’s scary as hell to put your heart in someone else’s hands, when their moods and feelings can change just a quickly as your own, but it’s also the most thrilling and worthwhile thing you can do with your time on earth.

And luckily, Stephen and Sara are both brave people. Now, I know Sara has the well-earned reputation of leaping into the unknown like a Patagonia-clad Xena Warrior Princess, but Stephen’s been brave for a long time too.

In middle school, he didn’t take the easy, predictable route and play the trumpet or drums, Stephen chose to play the clarinet. He followed that up by quitting soccer to join the high school Speech Team and perform in plays. This is a man who has long had the conviction and confidence to lead his own life. So it’s no surprise that he took a chance to follow Sara up to Portland. Or that they now share a home, a dog, and an office.

It’s been obvious for a long time that you two have faith in yourselves, and it’s beautiful to see that you have faith in each other. And that’s what you’ll need as you continue to go on adventures together—faith, a sense of humor, and some snacks.

And you’re about to embark on the biggest adventure of them all—your honeymoon trip up Mt Everest!—just kidding, I’m talking about marriage.

And in marriage, like any other adventure, you don’t know exactly how things are gonna go. You’ve no doubt got great times ahead but there are gonna be some tough times too—just as there have been in the past. You’ll both be tested in ways you can’t predict. There are gonna be whole seasons to celebrate as you continue building a life together—and oh yeah, there are gonna be simmering car arguments. And with all the car sharing apps and rental car options, you don’t even need to own a car to have simmering car arguments—all you need is a relationship. But simmering car arguments and the honest conversations that follow are how you grow as a couple. So take your time and listen to each other, and try to love each other honestly, even when you can’t love each other easily.

And know that neither of you is ever alone. Everyone here is family. And everyone needs some support when they’re doing something brave. We are your scaffolding of love—so call us, we’re happy to get brunch, meet up for an aperol spritz, or go on a hike or whatever.

---

To wrap things up, I have a quote from a French pilot, writer, and adventurer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry that fits these two nicely. It goes “Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction.”

I love you guys and I think you have so much to look forward to.

Sara and Stephen have written their own vows and will now recite them to each other.
