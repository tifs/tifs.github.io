            <br>
            I grew up stuttering, shy, and sunscreened in suburban New Jersey.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a younger man, I spent ten years putting on pads, tackling people, and fitting poorly into most clothes. Distance running changed me profoundly and almost tore my meniscus entirely. A yoga mat or bike lane are the only places safe for me now.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm instantly and automatically friends with every redheaded person I meet, pass on the street, or see on the internet. Same thing with all dogs.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's been six plus years in advertising, about a year and a half writing code.
            <br>
            <br>
            Any time between projects you’ll find me accidentally gentrifying some charming neighborhood in the city I love and live in, San Francisco. There’s always sunblock in my backpack if you need any.
